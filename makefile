# Makefile for COMP122 Programming Assignments
#   Allows students:
#     - to test their code
#     - to validate the structure of their submission
#     - to confirm their submission
#     - to understand how the Prof will grade their assignments

# Typically, there are three parts to every assignment.
#   Each part of the assignment must be associated with a single branch
#   For each part you want graded, a global tag MUST be associated a specific commit

# Minimum Requirements for Grading (per part)
#   1. A tracking branch must be established for said part
#   1. A minimal number of commits have been made to this branch
#   1. The branch must be merged with main when complete
#   1. A tag has been associated with this merge point
#   1. This tag has been been pushed to the origin
#   1. The commit date of the global tag must be on or BEFORE the DUE_DATE

# Associated Workflow
#    1. Create tracking branch
#       `git branch -c ${BRANCH}`
#       `git --set-upstream-to=origin ${BRANCH}
#    1. Development
#       `git switch ${BRANCH}`
#       LOOP:  edit, test, commit
#    1. Done:
#       `git switch main`
#       `git merge $BRANCH`
#       `git tag ${BRANCH}_submitted
#    1. Submit
#       `git push`
#       `git push origin ${BRANCH}`
#       `git push origin ${BRANCH}_submitted`

# Make Targets explained
# 
# all: (the first target)
#   - the standard default target
#   - provides a menu to inform the student on top-level targets
#
# test_${BRANCH}:
#   - uses the simple testing harness (sth) to test the code within a directory
#   - it presumes the current work directory is correct
#   - does NOT require the code to be pushed to the remote
#   - does NOT perform any git operations
#
# validate:
# validate_${BRANCH}:
#   - checks the administrative requirements of the assignment
#   - used by the github to run a validation check of a student submission
#   - invoked by github via `make -k validate`
#
# confirm:
# confirm_${BRANCH}
#   - validates the administrative requirements are meet
#   - test the code as it appears in the remote, i.e., submitted code
#
# validate_*:
#   - a series of individual tests that validate one administrative requirement
#
# clean:
#   - standard rule to do cleanup work
