# git rev-list: Lists commit objects in reverse chronological order
#
# It provides a number of options to filter this list of objects.
# One filter that it not present is to select the commit in which
# a branch is created.
#
# This script can be used to determine this commit:
#
# Proposal command:
#
#   git branch --starting-point  <branch> [main_branch]
#
#      - determines the commit point on the main_branch in which 
#        the command `git branch <branch>` was executed
#      - the default main_branch is 'main'
#
# Current command:
#
#   git_branch_starting_point  <branch> [main_branch]   
#
